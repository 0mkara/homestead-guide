* settings in `conf.py`
* code up index with proposed structure
* compile/deploy on readthedocs
* include cheatsheat, rst/sphinx/readthedocs resources

* allocate chapters to people (ideally author and reviewer)
* migrate old wiki under frontier/wiki (all md files converted to rst)
* migrate old frontier-guide content under frontier/gitbook (all md content converted to rst)
* script to annotate entire wiki with legacy warning

Strategy for migrating old fronter-guide content
========================================================

  * rst cheatsheet
  * rst/sphinx/readthedocs resources
  * compilation/deployment instructions
  * link to issues and process
  * style guide, conventions
* include the rst conversion of the wiki
