OS X DMG (disk image)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We generate OS X disk images
`for each release <https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/releases>`_.
These should work on Yosemite and el Capitan.  We do not support older OS X
versions and never will.  We only support 64-bit builds and will never support
32-bit OS X builds.

Here is the
`cpp-ethereum v1.2.1 OS X DMG
<https://build.ethdev.com/cpp-binaries-data/release-1.2.1/Ethereum.dmg>`_ for Homestead.
