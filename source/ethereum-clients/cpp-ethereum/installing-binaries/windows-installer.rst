Windows installer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We generate Windows installers
`for each release <https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/releases>`_.  These
should work on Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10.   We only support 64-bit
builds.   It may be possible to get the client working for Windows 32-bit, but
that is not something we will ever support.

Here is the
`cpp-ethereum v1.2.1 Windows installer
<https://build.ethdev.com/cpp-binaries-data/release-1.2.1/Ethereum.exe>`_ for Homestead.
