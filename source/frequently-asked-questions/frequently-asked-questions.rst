* **I have heard of Ethereum, but what are Geth, Mist, Ethminer AlethZero and AlethOne?**
  As you already know, Ethereum is the blockchain-based smart contract platform that this Wiki describes. Akin to Bitcoin, Ethereum needs miners to solve cryptographic puzzles to confirm transactions and bring the platform's cryptocurrency into existence, nodes to witness and record any transactions/computations made and 'wallets' to initiate transactions/computations. The programs in the header therefore performs one or more of these functions:
.. _Geth: This is the Go implementation of an Ethereum node, and is the basis for any interactions with the Ethereum blockchain. Running this locally will allow you to easily interact with the Ethereum blockchain. 
.. _Mist: This is the equivalent of a web browser, but then for the Ethereum blockchain. It acts as a GUI to display the accounts and contracts that you have or use on the Ethereum blockchain. It also allows you to create and interact with contracts in a graphical user interface without ever touching the command line. If you are not a developer and just want to store Ether and interact with Ethereum contracts, then Mist is the program to use. 
.. _AlethZero/AlethOne: These are hardcore clients for working with Ethereum, with AlethOne being the later version. Once Geth is running in the background, you can use these to deploy contracts, mine for ether, set up private blockchains, etc. 
.. _Ethminer: This is the dedicated software to use if you want to mine ether.
* **How can I store big files on the blockchain?**
  Swarm_ is an Ethereum-specific project for distributed file storage. IPFS_ is an independent project which has close ties to Ethereum; it will be used independently and may be used as the layer underlying Swarm.
* **Is ethereum based on bitcoin?**
  Only in the sense that it uses a blockchain, which Bitcoin pioneered. Ethereum has a separate blockchain that has several signigicant technical differences from Bitcoin.
* **What other cool apps are being built?** See this list from Ethercasts_.
* **What's the future of Ethereum?** We are planning a switch to Proof of Stake_ in the near future. We are also investigating scalability_ solutions and how to store_ secrets on the blockchain

* **How can I use Ethereum to get information about the future?**
  Augur_ and Gnosis_ are building prediction markets that try to gather the best information about uncertain future events
