Inception
================================================================================
Ethereum was initially described by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 as a result of his research and work in the Bitcoin community. Shortly thereafter, Vitalik published the `Ethereum white paper <http://vbuterin.com/ethereum.html>`_, where he describes in detail the technical design and rationale for the Ethereum protocol and smart contracts architecture. In January 2014, Ethereum was formally announced by Vitalik at the The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida, USA. From that moment on, the excitement around Ethereum and the its momentum has grown at a dramatic pace. 

Around that time, Vitalik also started working with Dr. Gavin Wood and together co-founded Ethereum. By April 2014, Gavin published the `Ethereum Yellow Paper <http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf>`_ that would serve as the technical specification for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). By following the detailed specification in the Yellow Paper, the Ethereum client has been implemented in six programming languages (C++, Go, Python, Java, JavaScript, and Haskell), which results in overall code that is higher in quality and stability.

Ethereum Foundation
=======================================================================


In addition to developing the software for Ethereum, the ability to launch a new cryptocurrency and blockchain requires a massive bootstrapping effort in order to assemble the resources needed to get Ethereum up and running. To kickstart a large network of developers, investors, miners, and other stakeholders, Ethereum announced its plan to conduct a crowdsale of ether, the currency unit of Ethereum. The legal complexities of raising funds through a crowdsale led to the creation of the

The Ethereum Crowdsale
---------------------------------------------------------------

To finance development, Ethereum distributed the initial allocation of ether via a 42-day public crowdsale, netting 31,591 bitcoins, worth $18,439,086 at that time, in exchange for about 60,102,216 ether.[
