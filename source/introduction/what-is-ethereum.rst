What is Ethereum?
********************************************************************************

Ethereum is a technology ecosystem that consists of software, development tools, people, and cryptocurrency –– based on a next generation blockchain technology. 


A next generation blockchain
=======================================================================
A blockchain is a distributed computing architecture where every network node executes and records the same transactions, grouped in blocks, where each block contains the mathematical calculation that validates it contains all of the transactions and is based on the previous block. If all nodes in the blockchain network have consensus on each block in the chain, then this enables a sort of distributed ledger or replicated database of the transactions that occurred.  

Blockchain technology first became prevalent through Bitcoin, which originated from Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", published in 2009.  As a blockchain platform, it enables a decentralized ledger of transactions that are recorded and verified on all participating nodes in the network. Hence, it allows Bitcoin to serve as a digital currency where transactions are recorded in the blockchain and can be verified by all network nodes. For users, this enables one to reliably send money to another user anywhere in the world without a centralized payments platform. 

In 2014, Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood began work on a next generation blockchain that had ambitions beyond Bitcoin and digital currency. 
They perceived several shortcomings in the Bitcoin technology, most notably the lack of a Turing-complete programming language. By implementing a programming language and virtual machine for code execution, Ethereum has become a platform for distributed applictions and smart contracts. 

Key components
---------------------------------------------------------------
There are many advancements that have been built into Ethereum, including but not limited to:

* **Development tools:** Ethereum offers a wide range of development tools and programming languages to enable the development of smart contracts and decentralized apps (a.k.a, DApps). 
* **Accounts:** In Bitcoin, there is no data structure that represents an account with a balance where funds can be credited or debited. Instead, Bitcoin aggregates payments that have not been spent (unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs) to determine how much Bitcoin a wallet contains. In Ethereum, Accounts are a central part of the network and are essential part of any transaction or contract. 
* **Cryptofuel for gas and fees:** All requests in the Ethereum blockchain require some amount of ether (the Ethereum currency) to pay for the computing resources consumed. This has the added benefit of reducing DDoS/spam attacks, since every request requires the sender to pay for it.
* **Light client protocol:** Ethereum is also designed to run in low-capacity environments such as smartphones and embedded devices, while still operating securely in relation to the Ethereum network state. This will facilitate the development of solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) that can participate as light client nodes on the Ethereum network.

A digital currency and cryptofuel
=======================================================================
The monetary unit of Ethereum is called ether and can be used for payments between Ethereum accounts, which can either belong to individuals or smart contracts. Like other digital currencies, it has a market price relative to other currencies, both fiat and digital – and can be bought and sold in online exchanges. As Ethereum adoption grows, ether will be supported by payment networks for purchasing goods online, which will increase demand for ether. 

Notably, Ethereum is unique in the realm of cryptocurrencies in that ether has utility value as a cryptofuel, commonly referred to as "gas". Beyond transaction fees, gas is a central part of every network request and requires the sender to pay for the computing resources consumed. The gas cost is dynamically calculated, based on the volume and complexity of the request, multiplied by the current gas price. Its value as a cryptofuel has the effect of increasing the long-term demand for ether, rather than limited to its value for payments or to market speculation of price movement.


A platform for decentralized apps
=======================================================================
A decentralized app, or DApp.

Web 3.0
---------------------------------------------------------------

* A giant decentralized computer.
* peer-to-peer
* IPFS (third party)


Smart contracts
---------------------------------------------------------------
One of the most important capabilities for Ethereum developers is the ability to write and execute smart contracts. The idea of "smart contracts" was first posited by Nick Szabo in 1993 as a type of automated software where the terms of a contract can be written as code and executed by the software. With Ethereum, the idea of smart contracts becomes reality by providing users with the programming languages and tools for writing contract code to run on the Ethereum network.  

At the launch of the Ethereum Frontier network in 2015, developers were provided with a Javascript-like programming language called Solidity which could be written and tested in a development environment called AlethZero. Developers also have the option of writing contracts in a new Python-like language called Serpent.


Private blockchains and applications
