What is Ethereum?
********************************************************************************

Ethereum is a number of things. 


From a developer point-of-view

It is many things and easier to describe with the following concepts 

* Platform for smart contracts
* A new blockchain with a built-in programming language 

* Bitcoin was design as an experiment


* Origin of blockchain technology, decentralized p2p,
* Fundamentally different from centralized computer architectures


A next generation blockchain
=======================================================================
A "blockchain" is a distributed computing architecture where every network node executes and records the same transactions, grouped in blocks, where each block contains the mathematical calculation that verifies it is based on the previous block. If all nodes in the blockchain network have consensus on each block in the chain, then this enables a sort of distributed ledger or replicated database of the transactions that occurred.  

Blockchain technology first became prevalent through Bitcoin, which originated from Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", published in 2009.  As a blockchain platform, it enables a decentralized ledger of transactions that are recorded and verified on all participating nodes in the network. Hence, it allows Bitcoin to serve as a digital currency where transactions are recorded in the blockchain and can be trusted by all network nodes. For users, this enables one to reliably send money to another user anywhere in the world without a centralized payments platform. 

In 2014, Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood began work on a next generation blockchain that had ambitions beyond Bitcoin and digital currency. 
They perceived several shortcomings in the Bitcoin technology, most notably the lack of a Turing-complete programming language. With an integrated programming language and virtual machine for code execution, Ethereum has become a platform for distributed applictions and smart contracts. 

Of course, there are many other advancements that have been built into Ethereum, including but not limited to:

* **Cryptofuel for gas and fees:** All requests in the Ethereum blockchain require some amount of ether (the Ethereum currency) to pay for the computing resources consumed. This has the added benefit of reducing DDoS/spam attacks, since every request requires the sender to pay for it.
* **Accounts:** In Bitcoin, there is no data structure that represents an account with a balance where funds can be credited or debited. Instead, Bitcoin aggregates payments that have not been spent (unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs) to determine how much Bitcoin a wallet contains. Ethereum jettisons this scheme in favor of Accounts, which greatly simplify the handling of account balances and reduce the .
* **Light client protocol:** Ethereum is also designed to run in low-capacity environments such as smartphones and embedded devices, while still operating securely in relation to the Ethereum network state. This will enable decentralized 

(think Raspberry Pi, Internet of Things, etc), where the device only needs to manage the parts of the Ethereum network that are relevant.




A platform for smart contracts
=======================================================================

The idea of "smart contracts" was first posited by Nick Szabo in 1993 as a type of automated software where the terms of a contract can be written as code and performed.

A cryptofuel economy
==================================

Ether is the internal 'fuel' of Ethereum. Programs running on Ethereum need to pay the network for the resources they consume. Volunteers earn this ether by validating transactions, securing the network.
