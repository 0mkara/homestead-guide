What is Ethereum?
********************

Ethereum is a number of things. 


From a developer point-of-view

It is many things and easier to describe with the following concepts 

* Platform for smart contracts
* A new blockchain with a built-in programming language 

* Bitcoin was design as an experiment


* Origin of blockchain technology, decentralized p2p,
* Fundamentally different from centralized computer architectures


A next generation blockchain
==================================
A "blockchain" is a distributed computing architecture where every network node executes and records the same transactions, grouped in blocks, where each block contains the mathematical calculation that verifies it is based on the previous block. If all nodes in the blockchain network have consensus on each block in the chain, then this enables a sort of distributed ledger or replicated database of the transactions that occurred.  

Blockchain technology first became prevalent through Bitcoin, which originated from Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" in 2009.  As a blockchain platform, it enables a decentralized ledger of transactions that are recorded and verified on all participating nodes in the network. Hence, it allows Bitcoin to perform as a digital currency where transactions are recorded in the blockchain and can be trusted by all network nodes. Since then, numerous other cryptocurrencies have been created; some with technological improvements that ...

Beginning in 2013, Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood began to conceive of a next generation blockchain, called Ethereum, that had ambitions beyond Bitcoin and digital currency. 

They felt there were certain things that were lacking in the Bitcoin blockchain protocol and software stock. Here's a brief summary:

* A Turing-complete* programming language. A complete programming language would enable "smart contracts"
* Support for lightweight client nodes. In the next generation Internet (Web 3.0), it will be essential for
* Improved Proof of Work 
They perceived many shortcomings of Bitcoin blockchain technology, notably

A platform for smart contracts
============================================

The idea of "smart contracts" was first posited by Nick Szabo in 1993 as a type of automated software where the terms of a contract can be represented by code and executed 

that can carry out the terms of a contract that is represented by code. Ethereum

A platform for decentralized apps
============================================

A giant decentralized computer.

A decentralized network of computers has unique challenges not faced by computers that participate in a traditional, centralized client-server model.

A cryptofuel economy
==================================

Ether is the internal 'fuel' of Ethereum. Programs running on Ethereum need to pay the network for the resources they consume. Volunteers earn this ether by validating transactions, securing the network.
