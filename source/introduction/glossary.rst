   Đ
      Đ, `D with stroke <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_with_stroke>`_, is used in Old English, Middle English, Icelandic, and Faroese to stand for an uppercase letter "Eth". The uppercase eth (Ð) is also used to symbolize the cryptocurrency Dogecoin.

   Dapp
   Đapp
      Unofficially stands for either "distributed app" or "eth app". Some say it is pronounced Ethapp due to the use of the uppercase eth letter Ð.

   ether
      Ether is the name of the currency used within Ethereum. It is used to pay for computations within the EVM.

   EOA
      An account controlled by a private key. If you own the private key associated with the EOA you have the ability to send ether and messages from it. This differs from a contract account that has it's own code and is controlled by code. EOAs and contract accounts may be combined into a single account type during Serenity.

   gas
      Name for the execution fee for every operation made on an Ethereum blockchain.

   gas limit
      
   gas price
      Price (in ether) of one unit of gas specified in the transaction.

   account
      
   transaction
      The signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account. Simply put, a transaction describes a transfer of information from an EOA to another EOA or a contract account.

   message
      A data transfer mechanism contracts use to communicate with other contracts. Messages can also be described as virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment.

   DAO
      
   Epoch
      Epoch is the interval between each regeneration of the DAG used as seed by the PoW algorithm Ethash. The epoch in specified as 30000 blocks.

   nonce
      Number Used Once or Number Once. A nonce, in information technology, is a number generated for a specific use, such as session authentication. Typically, a nonce is some value that varies with time, although a very large random number is sometimes used. In general usage, nonce means “for the immediate occasion” or “for now.”
      In the case of Blockchain Proof of Work scenarios, the hash value, found by a Miner, matching the network's Difficulty thus proving the Block Validity is called Nonce as well.

   uncle
      Uncles are blockchain blocks found by a miner, when different miner has already found another block for the corresponding place in the blockchain. They are called “stale blocks”. The parent of an Uncle is an ancestor of the inserting block, located at the tip of the blockchain. In contrast to the Bitcoin network, Ethereum rewards stale blocks as well in order to avoid to penalise miners with a bad connection to the network. This is less critical In the Bitcoin network, because the Block Time there is much higher (~10 minutes) than on the Ethereum network (aimed to ~15 seconds, Frontier).

   DAG
      DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph. It is a graph, a set of nodes and links between nodes, that has very special properties.
      Ethereum uses a DAG in Ethash, the Ethereum Proof of Work (POW) algorithm.The Ethash DAG takes a long time to be generated, which is done by a Miner node into a cache file for each Epoch. The file data is then used when a value from this graph is required by the algorithm. Directed Acyclic Graph Daggerav.

Obsolete Terminology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TODO
  put this into the glossary marked as obsolete `

   HLL
      Acronym for Higher Level Language, which is what Serpent and Solidity are. HLL is what early Ðapp developers called Ethereum programming languages that did not touch the low level elements. This phrase has been phased out.

   CLL
      Acronym for C Like Language, which Mutan was. This acronym has been phased out.

   ES1, ES2, and ES3
      "Ethereum Script" versions 1,2 and 3. There were early versions of what would become the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
