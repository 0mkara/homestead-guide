EVM Compilers
********************************************************************************

Contracts live on the blockchain in an Ethereum-specific binary format (Ethereum Virtual Machine (=EVM) bytecode). However, contracts are typically written in some high level language such as solidity and then compiled into byte code to be uploaded on the blockchain.

Below are the different compilers supported in Ethereum which allow you to compile your Smart Contract into a EVM specific bytecode:

**Serpent** - Serpent is a language similar to Python which can be used to develop Contracts in a high level language and compile to EVM bytecode. More details can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Serpent

**Solidity** - Solidity is a language similar to JavaScript which allows you to develop Contracts and compile to EVM bytecode. More details can be found here: http://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
