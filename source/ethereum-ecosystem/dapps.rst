      . A service that enables direct interaction between end users and providers (e.g. connecting buyers and sellers in some marketplace, owners and storers in file storage). Ethereum dapps typically interface users via an HTML/Javascript web application using a Javascript API to communicate with the blockchain. Dapps would typically have their own suite of associated contracts on the blockchain.


Dapp directories
====================================

Dapps that use Ethereum are compiled to the following lists. They are listed in various stages of development (concept, working prototype, live/deployed). If you are developing a dapp, consider adding an entry to these listings:

* `Ethercasts State of the √êapps <http://dapps.ethercasts.com/>`_
* `Dappslist <https://dappslist.com/>`_
* `Dappcentral <http://dappcentral.io/>`_ - Sortable pages for Dapps with instructions, code validation, and network stats.
* `Dapps Mailing List <http://dapplist.net/>`_ - Mailing list for developers on Ethereum (discontinued).

The offered decentralised services listed cover a wide range of areas inlcuding finance, insurance, prediction markets, social networks, distributed computation and storage, gambling, marketplace, internet of things, governance, collaboration, development and games.

In the future, dapps are likely to be listed and distributed in `dappstores_ <http://dappstore.io/>`_ integrated in dapp browsers.
