TODO
   To be extended with wallets and ether storage services and merchant/market services


In order to obtain Ether, you need to either
* become an Ethereum miner (see _`Mining`)  or
* trade other currencies for Ether

Trustless services
----------------------------

Note that the ethereum platform is special in that the smart contracts enable trustless services that obviate the need for trusted third parties in a currency exchange transaction, ie. disintermediate currency exchange businesses.

Such projects (alpha/prelaunch status at the time of writing) are
* `BTCrelay <>`_ - /
  * `Towards ETH/BTC 2-way peg <https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/taking-stock-bitcoin-and-ethereum-4382f0a2f17>`_
* `EtherEx decentralised exchange <https://etherex.org>`_
