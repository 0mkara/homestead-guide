Developer Tools
********************************************************************************
As a Ðapp developer you have three main resources which allow Ðapp
development.

IDEs/Frameworks
================================================================================

- `Mix Ethereum IDE <https://github.com/ethereum/mix>`__ - Mix is an IDE that allows developers to build and deploy contracts and decentralized applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It includes a Solidity source code debugger.
- `Truffle <https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle>`__ - Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum.
- `Dapple <https://github.com/nexusdev/dapple>`__ - Dapple is a tool for Solidity developers to help build and manage complex contract systems on Ethereum-like blockchains.
- `Populus <http://populus.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ - Populus is a Smart Contract development framework written in python.
- `Embark <https://iurimatias.github.io/embark-framework/>`__ - Embark is a Ðapp development framework written in JavaScript.

The EVM
================================================================================
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is not only sandboxed, but actually completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem, or other processes. Smart contracts even have limited access to other smart contracts.

Contracts live on the blockchain in an Ethereum-specific binary format (EVM bytecode). However, contracts are typically written in an Ethereum high level language, compiled into byte code using an EVM compiler, and finally uploaded on the blockchain using an Ethereum client.


Solidity Contract Language Resources
================================================================================
-  `Solidity
   Documentation <https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ -
   Solidity is the flagship Ethereum high level language that is used to write contracts.
-  `Standardized Contract
   APIs <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Standardized_Contract_APIs>`__

Other Tools
================================================================================
-  `Useful Ðapp
   Patterns <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Useful-Ðapp-Patterns>`__
   - Code snippets which are useful for Ðapp development.
